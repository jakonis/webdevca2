As a part of my CA 2, I have developed a vue.js web app. The web app is hosted on firebase, database is also sored and updated on firebase. The websites functionality is to create reviews, view and delete them and also update them. The web app also includes google maps API. On the map page the users are able to search a location and add a marker on the searched location
